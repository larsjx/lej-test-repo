# Regarding the bookmarks file in this repo â€“

## I really apologize for it being *so ugly and full of invalid HTML*.
## It was created VERY quickly as reference for anyone who wants it by:

  * Cutting out the relevant portions of a Chrome bookmarks file
  * Converting that to Safari bookmarks to strip off the metadata
  * Very quickly editing the Safari file to move a few items around

## I hope it helps you find something new and useful :-)
