## Regarding the bookmarks file in this repo â€“

### I apologize for the very unattractive and invalid HTML.
#### It was created quickly as resource for anyone who wants it by:

  * Cutting out the relevant portions of a Chrome bookmarks file
  * Converting that to Safari bookmarks to strip off the metadata
  * Very quickly editing the Safari file to move a few items around

#### I hope it helps you find something new and useful :-)
